MAKE IT INTO README.MD
Okay, the user wants me to convert the previous README text into a proper README.md file. Let me start by recalling what the user provided earlier. They had a C program for Morse code conversion and then asked for a GitHub README. I gave them a comprehensive markdown structure with features, installation steps, usage examples, etc. Now the user is saying "MAKE IT INTO README.MD" which probably means they want the content formatted correctly as a markdown file.

First, I need to ensure that the markdown syntax is correct. Let me check the headers, code blocks, tables, and badges. The previous response included badges for C version, license, and build status. Those use the correct image URLs and syntax. The table for supported characters uses markdown table formatting, which is fine.

I should also verify that the installation and usage instructions are accurate. The user provided a C program, so compiling with gcc is appropriate. The examples show input and output, which helps users understand how to interact with the program.

The user might want the README to be ready to copy and paste into a GitHub repository. So I need to make sure there's no placeholder text. In the original README.md draft, the GitHub clone URL uses "yourusername" which should be replaced with the actual username or repository URL. However, since the user hasn't provided specific details, maybe it's best to leave it as a placeholder but mention that they should update it.

Also, check for any markdown errors. For example, code blocks should be properly enclosed with triple backticks and the correct language specified. The headers use # symbols correctly. The emojis are optional but add visual appeal, so keeping them is good unless the user prefers otherwise.

Another consideration is the license section. The original mentions GPLv3, so the user should have a LICENSE file in their repo. The README links to it, which is correct. The contributing section outlines steps for others to follow, which is standard for open-source projects.

The acknowledgments section gives proper credit, which is good practice. The user might want to add more references or adjust those as needed.

I should also ensure that all sections are necessary. The features, installation, usage, requirements, supported characters, contributing, license, and acknowledgments are all relevant. The user might want to add a "Testing" section or "Future Features," but unless they ask for it, the current structure is sufficient.

Finally, make sure the markdown is clean without any typos or formatting issues. For example, ensuring that lists are properly indented and that there's a newline before and after code blocks for correct rendering on GitHub.

Here's the formatted README.md ready for GitHub:
